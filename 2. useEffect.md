`useEffect` is another essential hook provided by React. It allows you to perform **side effects** in functional components. Side effects could be anything that affects the outside world, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions. Let's delve into the details and explore some common use cases:

### What is `useEffect`?

`useEffect` is a hook in React that enables performing side effects in functional components. It takes two arguments: a function that represents the side effect, and an optional array of dependencies. React will call the effect function after rendering and after every update, unless specified otherwise.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### How does `useEffect` work?

1. **Mounting and Updating**: When a component mounts or updates, React schedules the side effect function to run after the browser has painted the screen.

2. **Cleanup**: If the effect returns a cleanup function, React will call it before running the effect next time or unmounting the component. This is useful for cleaning up any resources used by the effect.

3. **Dependencies**: You can pass an optional array of dependencies to `useEffect`. React will re-run the effect only if the values in the dependency array change between renders. If the array is empty, the effect will only run once after the initial render.

### Use Cases and Examples:

#### 1. Data Fetching:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetching() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <ul>
          {data.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Event Listeners:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function WindowResize() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      console.log("Window resized");
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return <p>Resize the window to see the effect</p>;
}
```

#### 3. Document Title Update:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function DocumentTitle() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Additional Notes:

- It's important to handle cleanup in effects, especially for subscriptions, timers, or event listeners, to avoid memory leaks.
- Avoid performing expensive operations inside effects, as they can impact performance.
- Be mindful of dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders or missed updates.

By using `useEffect`, you can incorporate side effects into your functional components, ensuring they have the necessary interactivity and integration with external resources.
